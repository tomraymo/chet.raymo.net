                                It is the year 998 A.D., two years before what
                                much of Christian Europe believes will be the
                                year of the Apocalypse. Strengthened by the
                                devotion of a fearful and superstitious
                                populace, the Church is seeking to harness a
                                decaying Holy Roman Empire by asserting its
                                absolute authority in interpreting the will of
                                God.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So Aileran, abbot of a now-abandoned island
                                monastery off the coast of Ireland, a man once
                                believed to be a saint, is called to account for
                                heresy. His accuser is his best friend, Gerbert,
                                the charismatic fellow monk who first introduced
                                Aileran to literature and geometry, to the
                                pleasures of the flesh and perhaps to sin;
                                Gerbert, now known as Pope Sylvester II.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Alone in self-exile, racked with pride, guilt
                                and despair, Aileran struggles to make sense of
                                the events that have led him to this pass. He
                                recalls his idyllic childhood, which ended in
                                violence; his education and adventures in the
                                most renowned monasteries and courts of the age;
                                and above all, his passionate and troubled
                                relationship with the woman Melisande, who
                                changed everything.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Eventually Aileran will have to come off his
                                beautiful and desolate island to stand trial and
                                to confront Gerbert and the woman he failed in
                                love. But before the year 1000 dawns, one
                                heretic at least will have to die.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Based on real events, places and people,
                                <em>In the Falcon&rsquo;s Claw</em> is a magical
                                evocation of the political and pastoral
                                landscapes of tenth-century Europe and a
                                resonant tale of love and friendship. In the
                                startlingly beautiful prose which has long
                                distinguished his nonfiction books, Chet Raymo
                                brings the distant past to life while exploring
                                ageless questions of faith and spirit.

                            <p class="lead">The lessons of contemporary science are not immediately reassuring: we are
                                not
                                the lords and purpose of creation; we are ordinary, perhaps even typical, fragments of
                                a
                                universe vast beyond our reckoning; nature is indifferent to our concerns. Faced with
                                these
                                disconcerting truths, which contradict traditional beliefs, many people turn from
                                science
                                with distrust or downright hostility. Often, they look instead to creationism,
                                astrology,
                                parapsychology, and other pseudosciences for a sense of meaning and worth.</p>
                            <p>Science <em>can</em> be remote, frightening, incomphrehensible. It is also a sublime
                                attempt
                                by the human mind to make sense of the world, and its discoveries have made life richer
                                and
                                more secure for much of the world&rsquo;s population. <em>The Virgin and the Mousetrap</em>
                                addresses our fears about science, and weighs the gifts of scientific knowledge against
                                their costs. In his search for the soul of science&mdash;and for our own sense of place
                                in
                                the universe described by science&mdash;Raymo explores such topics as environmental
                                responsibility, the use of animals in research, and technology in the service of
                                national
                                defense.</p>
                            <p>These essays draw upon literature, art, history, and philosophy to forge a
                                reconciliation
                                between scientific and humanistic concerns. If science is a mirror to creation, then it
                                is
                                also a mirror to ourselves. In <em>The Virgin and the Mousetrap</em>, Raymo looks into
                                the
                                mirror of science for life-affirming reflections of the human spirit.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Years ago, noted science teacher and writer Chet Raymo embarked upon his
                                own
                                quest to reconcile the miracle stories he learned as a child with the science he
                                learned as
                                an adult. <em>Skeptics and True Believers</em> is the culmination of that
                                search&mdash;a
                                passionate, ever-inquisitive statement that science and religion can mutually reinforce
                                the
                                way we experience the world.</p>
                            <p>Acknowledging that the scientific and the spiritual communities are increasingly split,
                                Raymo builds strong bridges between them. He illustrates his argument with an array of
                                thought-provoking stories, such as the remarkable migratory flight of a small bird
                                called
                                the red knot; the long, glorious glide of the Comet Hyakutake across the night sky; a
                                hilarious alien abduction that didn&rsquo;t happen. Together, they are compelling
                                evidence
                                that
                                religion should embrace the reliable knowledge of the world that science provides,
                                while at
                                the same time science should respect and nourish humankind&rsquo;s need for spiritual
                                sustenance.
                                &ldquo;Miracles are explainable,&rdquo; Raymo paraphrases the writer Tim Robinson,
                                &ldquo;it is the
                                explanations that are miraculous.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>For anyone drawn to reflect on life&rsquo;s meaning and purpose, Chet Raymo&rsquo;s
                                uncompromising
                                skepticism and reverence for mystery will affirm and inspire.</p>

                                    science and religion. Raymo is a witty and clear-headed guide through the thickets

                                    current science&mdash;from evolutionary biology to the miracles of DNA codes and
                                    theories of the Big Bang. At the same time he is a sensitive interpreter of

                            <p class="lead">&ldquo;We are children of the night,&rdquo; proclaims Chet Raymo in this
                                rich,
                                exciting guide to the universe. Not so very long ago, the night sky was an intimate
                                part of
                                people&rsquo;s lives, often a source of religious and poetic inspiration. Gradually,
                                though,
                                the
                                glare of city lights, a fast-paced lifestyle, and &ldquo;prime-time&rdquo; television
                                have
                                eroded that intimacy. This book offers you the chance to recapture a personal
                                connection to
                                the heavens, enlarging your concept and appreciation of the universe rather than
                                feeling
                                diminished by its scale.</p>
                            <p>On one level, <em>An Intimate Look at the Night Sky</em> is a unique star guide:
                                twenty-four
                                beautiful star maps, created specifically for this book, cycle through the seasons and
                                across the heavens, revealing what you can see with the naked eye throughout the year
                                on a
                                clear night in the northern hemisphere. Raymo&rsquo;s commentaries amplify the maps,
                                offering
                                intriguing details and tips on identifying stars, planets, and constellations.</p>
                            <p>On another level, Chet Raymo challenges our imagination&mdash;to see what is unseeable
                                in
                                the
                                universe, to perceive distance and size and shape that is inconceivable, to appreciate
                                ever
                                more fully our extraordinary place in the cosmos. His elegant essays on the heavens
                                blend
                                science and history, mythology and religion, making clear why he is one of the most
                                insightful and passionate science writers of our time.</p>
                            <p>After reading <em>An Intimate Look at the Night Sky</em>, which is as visually appealing
                                as
                                it is intellectually stimulating, you will marvel as much at the wisdom of the ancients
                                as
                                at the advances of modern science. Chet Raymo&rsquo;s artistry enables us to see the
                                universe
                                we

                            <p class="lead">For nearly forty years, Chet Raymo has walked a one-mile path from his
                                house in
                                North Easton, Massachusetts, to the Stonehill College campus where he has taught
                                physics
                                and astronomy. The woods, meadows, and stream he passes are as familiar to him as his
                                own
                                backyard, yet each day he finds something new. &ldquo;Every pebble and wildflower has a
                                story to
                                tell,&rdquo; Raymo says.</p>
                            <p>In <em>The Path</em>, Raymo chronicles the universe he has found by closely observing
                                every
                                detail of
                                his route. He connects the local to the global, the microscopic to the galactic, with a
                                scientists&rsquo;s curiosity, a historian&rsquo;s respect for the past, a child&rsquo;s
                                capacity for
                                wonder.
                                With each step, the landscape he traverses becomes richer and more multidimensional,
                                opening door after door into astromnomy, geology, biology, history, and literaure.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;The flake of granite in the path was once at the core of towering mountains
                                pushed up
                                across New England when continents collided,&rdquo; he writes. &ldquo;The purple
                                loosestrife beside the
                                stream emigrated from Europe in the 1800s as a garden ornamental, then went wantonly
                                native
                                in a land of wild frontiers. The light from the star Arcturus I see reflected in the
                                brook
                                beneath the bridge at night has been traveling across space for forty years before
                                entering
                                my eye. I have attended to all of these stories and tried to hear what the landscape
                                has to
                                say .... I have attended, too, to language. How did the wood anemone and Sheep Pasture
                                get
                                their names? What does the queset of Queset Brook signify in the language of Native
                                Americans? Scratch a name in a landscape, and history bubbles up like a spring.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>The path also reveals the stories of nineteenth-century industrialists who transformed
                                natural resources into power, and turn-of-the-century landscape architects, such as
                                Frederick Law Olmsted, who championed an ideal of nature tamed by conscious intent. In
                                its
                                transformations over the centuries, Raymo writes, the path &ldquo;encapsulates in many
                                surprising
                                ways the history of our nation and of our fickle love affair with the natural
                                world.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>Recognizing that his path is commonplace, and that we all have such routes in our lives,
                                Raymo urges us to walk attentively, stopping often to watch and listen with care. His
                                wisdom and insights inspire us to turn local paths&mdash;whether through cities,
                                suburbs,
                                or
                                rural areas&mdash;into doorways to greater understanding of nature and history.</p>

                            <p class="lead">An acclaimed science writer celebrates an enduring symbol of Ireland’s
                                Celtic
                                past, Christian tradition, and love of nature.</p>
                            <p>Mount Brandon is one of several holy mountains in Ireland that attract scores of
                                believers
                                and secular trekkers from around the world. For thirty-two years, Chet Raymo has lived
                                part
                                of each year on the Dingle Peninsula, near the foot of the mountain, and he has climbed
                                it
                                perhaps a hundred times, exploring paths that have been used for centuries by pilgrims
                                in
                                search of spiritual enlightenment. But the history and geography of Mount Brandon are
                                what
                                drew Raymo to it and offered him a lens through which to view the modern conflicts
                                between
                                science and religion.</p>
                            <p>As he guides us up the mountain, Raymo weaves folklore and natural history, spiritual
                                and
                                physical geographies. He tells the stories of the pagan hero Bran and the Christian
                                saint
                                Brendan, whose name the mountain evokes. He also teases out the scientific story of the
                                mountain and its environs&mdash;spinning planet, drifting continents, grinding
                                glaciers,
                                globe-spanning ocean currents, animal and plant migrations&mdash;and discovers to his
                                surprise and delight how well our new empirical knowledge of the world is accomodated
                                by
                                the faith of the earliest Irish Christians.</p>
                            <p>When Ireland converted from paganism, it became home to a kind of Christianity that was
                                unique in Europe&mdash;intensely intellectual yet attuned to nature, skeptical yet
                                celebratory,
                                grounded in the here-and-now yet open to infinity&mdash;a faith that did not so much
                                look
                                upward to the heavens as westward into the wild dark sea.
                                Raymo takes us to a time on the wave-lashed edge of the Western
                                world when Mediterranean Christianity ran up against Celtic nature worship, and the
                                Irish, for a few exhilarating centuries, forged a fusion
                                of knowledge and mystery that has special relevance for us today.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Very little is known about the man who gave his name to romantic love, but
                                bestselling novelist Chet Raymo has imagined Valentine&rsquo;s life and brought it
                                vividly to
                                the
                                printed page.</p>
                            <p>There has long been a suggestion that Valentine was a doctor, and Raymo has built his
                                story
                                around the romance of the physician Valentine and the blind Julia, daughter of a Roman
                                jailer. Their love story provides the central thread of this engrossing novel, which
                                also
                                brings alive the world of the Roman Empire during the reign of Claudius II&mdash;a time
                                of
                                clashing and evolving worldviews, in which Christianity was on the rise while
                                Christians
                                were still among those whose deaths provided public entertainment at the Circus
                                Maximus.</p>
                            <p><em>Valentine</em> is a novel with remarkable resonances, its ideas startlingly relevant
                                to
                                our own times: globalization vs. fundamentalism, reason vs. superstition, the
                                subversion of
                                virtue by wealth&mdash;and the power of passionate love to overcome all obstacles to
                                its
                                consummation.</p>

                                of
                                zero longitude
                                and the standard for all the world&rsquo;s maps and clocks&mdash;to tell the story of

                                intellectual journey from a cosmos not much larger than ourselves to the universe of

                                galaxies and geologic eons.</p>
                            <p>As in his highly praised <em>The Path</em> and <em>Climbing Brandon</em>, Raymo connects
                                personally with the
                                story by walking England&rsquo;s Prime Meridian from Brighton through Greenwich to the

                                The Prime Meridian passes near a surprising number of landmarks that loom large in
                                science:
                                Isaac Newton&rsquo;s chambers at Trinity College, Cambridge; Charles Darwin&rsquo;s
                                home at Down,

                                Kent; the site where the first dinosaur fossils were discovered; and John
                                Harrison&rsquo;s
                                clocks
                                in a museum room of the Royal Observatory, among many others. Visiting them in turn,
                                Raymo
                                brings to life the human dramas of courageous individuals who bucked reigning
                                orthodoxies
                                to expand our horizons, including one brave rebel who paid the ultimate price for

                                the multitude of worlds we now take for granted.</p>

                                    &ldquo;The story of the prime meridian is in itself fascinating: in 1884 an
                                    international agreement fixed a meridian of zero longitude and standard time
                                    through
                                    southeast England. But Raymo, a physicist and science writer who wrote a popular

                                    column for the <em>Boston Globe</em>, goes beyond this tale. He uses an actual walk
                                    along the
                                    meridian as a &lsquo;thread on which to hang&rsquo; a history of astronomy, geology

                                    Darwins house at Down, the infamous town of Piltdown, and the place where the

                            <p class="lead">Chet Raymo steps into the fray between science and religion and seeks to
                                delineate a new perspective, forged from both the rigorous standards of the academy and
                                the
                                reverence for creation born of the Catholic sacramental tradition. As a scientist,
                                Raymo
                                holds to the skepticism that accepts only verifiable answers and replies to
                                life&rsquo;s
                                ultimate
                                questions with the agnostic response, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; But as a
                                &ldquo;religious
                                naturalist,&rdquo; he never ceases his pursuit of &ldquo;the beautiful and terrible
                                mystery
                                that soaks creation, diminished by any name we give it. Faith no longer matters to
                                me,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;so much as attention, celebration, wonder, and
                                praise.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>In what he describes as a &ldquo;late-life credo,&rdquo; Raymo traces a half-century
                                journey
                                from
                                traditional faith-based Catholicism to scientific agnosticism. The point of religion,
                                he
                                asserts, is to celebrate the unfathomable mystery of creation. Thus, he believes,
                                &ldquo;My
                                work
                                as a teacher and writer has been to discover glimmers of the Absolute in every
                                particular,
                                and praise what I find.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>Raymo takes the reader on a tour de force of science, philosophy, theology, and
                                literature
                                as he gathers together the rich array of voices of his many traveling companions. With
                                wonderfully detailed anecdotes, Raymo brings to life a diverse cadre of mentors such as
                                Gerard Manley Hopkins, Charles Darwin, and Teilhard de Chardin. Whether exploring the
                                connection of the human body to the stars or the meaning of prayer of the heart, these
                                challenging reflections will cause believers and agnostics alike to pause and pay
                                attention.</p>
